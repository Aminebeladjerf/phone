<p style="padding: 30px;width: 1000px;">According to rumors, the Galaxy S22 series will consist of three models: the base Galaxy S22, the Galaxy S22+, and the high-end Galaxy S22 Ultra. The devices are expected to feature significant upgrades over their predecessors, including a faster processor, improved camera, and larger battery.</p>

<p style="padding: 30px;width: 1000px;">The Galaxy S22 and S22+ are rumored to come with a 6.1-inch and 6.55-inch display, respectively, while the S22 Ultra is expected to sport a massive 6.8-inch screen. All three models are rumored to feature an AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p style="padding: 30px;width: 1000px;">In terms of performance, the Galaxy S22 series is expected to be powered by Samsung's own Exynos 2200 processor, which is based on the 4nm manufacturing process. The processor is said to be more powerful and energy-efficient than its predecessor, the Exynos 2100.</p>

<p style="padding: 30px;width: 1000px;">The camera department is also expected to receive an upgrade, with the Galaxy S22 and S22+ featuring a triple-lens setup, while the S22 Ultra is rumored to come with a quad-lens setup. The devices are expected to offer better low-light performance, improved autofocus, and enhanced zoom capabilities.</p>

<p style="padding: 30px;width: 1000px;">Another major upgrade is expected in the battery department, with the Galaxy S22 series rumored to feature larger batteries than their predecessors. The devices are expected to support fast charging, wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging.</p>
